<KoreanWord word="까지" />

The particle `까지` is used as a marker for moving between locations, and represents the "to"
destination, opposite the "from" source, as marked by [`에서`](../at-in-on.mdx).

## Guidelines

- The from location is listed first, followed by the to location.

## Examples

From home to school.

```
집에서 학교까지.
```
