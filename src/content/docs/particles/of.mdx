<KoreanWord word="의" />

The particle `의` is used to mark the possessive form of a noun. This is similar to the English `s'`
or `'s`, or `of` in "the book of John".

## Guidelines

- By default the particle is pronounced as "eu-ee" when on its own.
- But if it follows a noun and acts like a particle, it's pronounced as "ae".

## Examples

Miles' book.

마일스의 책.
