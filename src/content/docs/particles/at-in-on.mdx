<KoreanWord word="에" />

The particle `에` is used as a location or time marker. It's used in the following situations:

- Referencing a static location
- Referencing a point in time
- A destination or goal

This particle is often omitted when paired with `어디`.

<KoreanWord word="에서" />

On the other hand, the `에서` particle references a dynamic location in which an activity is
happening. This is typically paired with an action verb.
