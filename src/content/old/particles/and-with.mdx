<KoreanWord word="하고" />

The particle `하고` is used to connect two or more nouns in a sentence, primarily when listing them.
It can also be used to mean "with" when used with a person.

## Guidelines

- The particle appears after every noun except for the last one.

## Examples

I like apples, oranges, and bananas.

```
저는 사과하고 오렌지하고 바나나를 좋아해요.
```
